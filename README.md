# Enhancing EDA and Misclassification Analysis through Tree Structure Visualization

Final project in *Tabular Data Science* course by Dr. Amit Somech at Bar-Ilan University.

The project consists of two phases. In the first phase, a visualization called ICC was developed to overcome the limitations of scatter and jitter plots used in the EDA stage. In the second phase, an extension to ICC called MAGIC was created to explore the potential of using the ICC graph for misclassification analysis.

## Requirements and the Graphviz installation

* <mark>Graphviz library needs to be installed on the operating system.</mark>
For ubuntu, the installation is done via: `sudo apt install graphviz`. 
More details can be found [here](https://graphviz.org/download/ "here").

* Required Python libraries listed in the **requirements.txt** file and can be installed via the `pip install -r` command.

* Required Python libraries that are required but seen in class can be found in the **requirementsFromClass.txt** file. When needed, can be installed via the `pip install -r` command as well.

## Code

The notebooks and Python code for each phase can be found in the following folders:
* **ICC-notebooks** and **MAGIC-notebooks** for the examples of Jupiter notebooks.
* **ICC-code** and **MAGIC-code** for the Python code snippets. Each folder contains a readme file with instructions on how to run the code.

**Note:** Links to the online Colab notebooks are available [here](https://github.com/mhornstein/Tabular-Data-Science-Final-Project/blob/main/linksToOnlineColabNotebook.md "here").

## Tests
The code and notebooks were tested in the environments:
* Windows 10, python 3.10.8.
* Linux ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS, python 3.10.6.

## Additional Resources

* **Questionnaires**  -  Links to the questionnaires used in the project can be found [here](https://github.com/mhornstein/Tabular-Data-Science-Final-Project/blob/main/linksToQuestionnaires.md "here").
* **Report** â€“ The complete report is available in the [report.pdf](https://github.com/mhornstein/Tabular-Data-Science-Final-Project/blob/main/report.pdf "report.pdf") file.

# Enhancing EDA and Misclassification Analysis through Tree Structure Visualization

Final project in *Tabular Data Science* course by Dr. Amit Somech at Bar-Ilan University.

The project consists of two phases. In the first phase, a visualization called ICC was developed to overcome the limitations of scatter and jitter plots used in the EDA stage. In the second phase, an extension to ICC called MAGIC was created to explore the potential of using the ICC graph for misclassification analysis.

## Code

The notebooks and Python code for each phase can be accessed in the following folders:
* **ICC-notebooks** and **MAGIC-notebooks** for the example Jupiter notebooks.
* **ICC-code** and **MAGIC-code** for the Python code snippets. Each folder contains a readme file with instructions on how to run the code.

Additionally, the required Python libraries can be found in the **requirements.txt** file, which must be installed to run the code and launch the notebooks.

**Note:** Links to the online Colab notebook are available in the file [LinksToOnlineColabNotebookLinks.pdf](https://github.com/mhornstein/Tabular-Data-Science-Final-Project/blob/main/LinksToOnlineColabNotebookLinks.pdf "LinksToOnlineColabNotebookLinks.pdf").

## Tests
The code was tested in the environments:
* Windows 10, python 3.10.8.
* Linux ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS, python 3.6.

## Additional Resources

* **Questionnaires**  -  The questionnaires used in the project can be accessed through the links provided in the file LinksToQuestionnaires.pdf.
* **Report** â€“ The complete report is available in the report.pdf file.
